## dashu-int Improvements

- Division: trim the trailing zero words before division.
- GCD: trim the trailing zero words, and give the number of zeros as input to low-level algorithms.
- GCD: An idea of fast gcd check for rational number: don't do gcd reduction after every operation.
  For small numerators or denominators, we can directly do a gcd, otherwise, we first do gcd with a primorial that
  fits in a word, and only remove these small divisors.
  Further improvement: store a const divisor for the prime factors in the primorial, thus supports a fast factorial of
  the gcd result, and then divide with these const divisor.
- Power: implement a k-ary pow when exponent is too large (after lifting to at least a full word), this will store pre-computed 2^1~2^k powers. Maybe move this implementation to a separate module folder, and use the window selection function from modular pow.
- Logarithm: for very large est value, the est error can be large and there can be many fixing steps,
  we should use a similar strategy as the non_power_two formatter, using power sequence,
  or call log again on the target / est_pow
