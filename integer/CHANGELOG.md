# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (WIP)

### Add

- Implement `Gcd::gcd` and `ExtendedGcd::gcd_ext` between `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `DivRem::div_rem` between `UBig` and `IBig`

- Add `trailing_ones` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `TryFrom<f32>` and `TryFrom<f64>` for `UBig` and `IBig`

### Change

- `sqrt_rem` is only exposed through the `dashu_base::RootRem` trait now.
- `abs_cmp` is only exposed throught the `dashu_base::AbsCmp` trait now.
- `abs_eq` is only exposed throught the `dashu_base::AbsEq` trait now.
- `bit_len` and `bit` are only exposed throught the `dashu_base::BitTest` trait now.
- `Modulo::inv` now takes the reference of a `Modulo`.

### Remove

- `error::{OutOfBoundsError, ParseError}` are removed, related error types are added to `dashu-base`

## 0.2.1

### Add

- Add `sqrt`, `sqrt_rem`, `nth_root` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `core::iter::{Sum, Product}` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `num_traits::{Euclid, ToPrimitive, FromPrimitive}` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `num_integer::{Integer, Roots}` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `num_order::{NumHash, NumOrd}` for `UBig` and `IBig`
- Implement `zeroize::Zeroize` for `UBig`, `IBig` and internal types
- `serde` se/derialization now supports the `is_human_readable()` flag

## 0.2.0

### Add

- Expose the `Sign` enum and related operations with `UBig` and `IBig`
- Expose `DoubleWord` for easier operation with `Word`
- Add a public API `as_words` and `as_sign_words` to access internal representation of `UBig` and `IBig` respectively.
- Add const constructors `from_word`, `from_dword` and a direct constructor `from_words` for `UBig`.
- Add a const constructor `from_parts_const` and a director constructor `from_parts` for `IBig`
- Add `split_bits` and `clear_high_bits` for `UBig`.
- Add `remove` for `UBig`
- Add `abs_cmp`, `abs_eq` for `IBig`.
- Implement `Mul` between `Sign` and `UBig`/`IBig`.
- Implement `DivRemAssign` for `UBig` and `IBig`, and `DivRemAssign` is re-exported in the `ops` module.
- Implement integer logarithm `ilog` and approximated bounds of base 2 logarithm `log2_bounds`.

### Remove
- Remove `ubig!` and `ibig!` macros from the crate, more powerful versions of them will be included in a separate `dashu-macro` crate.

### Change

- Function `zero()`, `one()`, `neg_one()` are changed to associated constants `ZERO`, `ONE`, `NEG_ONE`.
- Function `gcd()` and `extended_gcd()` of `UBig` and `IBig` are changed to be associated functions of `Gcd` and `ExtendedGCD`.
- Parsing a string with unsupported radix will now return an Err instead of `panic!`.
- `from_str_with_radix_prefix` now also return the radix.
- Due to the requirement of `dashu-float`, the MSRV is now 1.61. Rust versions from 1.57 to 1.60 are still working for `dashu-int` in this version, but it won't be ensured in future releases.

### Improve
- Parsing integers from string support underscore separater.
- Improve speed for power function `pow()`

## 0.1.1

### Add

- Implemented modular inverse for the `Modulo` type.
- Implemented `gcd` and `extended_gcd` for `UBig` and `IBig`.

## 0.1.0

The code for big integer is ported from `ibig @ 0.3.5` with modifications stated in the [NOTICE](./NOTICE.md), the current MSRV for `dashu-int` is 1.57.

# Todo

- Division: trim the trailing zero words before division.
- GCD: trim the trailing zero words, and give the number of zeros as input to low-level algorithms.
- GCD: An idea of fast gcd check for rational number: don't do gcd reduction after every operation.
  For small numerators or denominators, we can directly do a gcd, otherwise, we first do gcd with a primorial that
  fits in a word, and only remove these small divisors.
  Further improvement: store a const divisor for the prime factors in the primorial, thus supports a fast factorial of
  the gcd result, and then divide with these const divisor.
- Power: implement a k-ary pow when exponent is too large (after lifting to at least a full word), this will store pre-computed 2^1~2^k powers. Maybe move this implementation to a separate module folder, and use the window selection function from modular pow.
- Logarithm: for very large est value, the est error can be large and there can be many fixing steps,
  we should use a similar strategy as the non_power_two formatter, using power sequence,
  or call log again on the target / est_pow
