- [ ] Remove bitwise operators between different signedness.
- [ ] Remove operations for UBig with signed primitive integers.
- [ ] Add operations between UBig and IBig (the result should be IBig)
- [ ] Format code and inspect inline/pub(crate) markers
- [ ] Add more tests to cover cases with inline double words
