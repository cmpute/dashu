/// Fast estimation of the binary logarithm of a number
pub trait EstimatedLog2 {
    /// Estimate the bounds of the binary logarithm.

    /// The result is `(lower bound, upper bound)` such that `lower bound ≤ log2(self) ≤ upper bound`.
    /// The precision of the bounds must be at least 8 bits (relative error < 2^-8).
    ///
    /// With `std` disabled, the precision is about 13 bits. With `std` enabled, the precision
    /// can be full 24 bits. But the exact precision is not guaranteed and should not be not
    /// relied on.

    /// For negative values, the logarithm is calculated based on its absolute value. If the number
    /// is zero, then negative infinity will be returned.
